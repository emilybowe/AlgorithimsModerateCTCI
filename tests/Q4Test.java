        Notes on previous solutions:
        -Incorrect use of Optionals
            (don't pass as parameter, should be more return values, also should be more to handle an outside function)
        -Less Global Variables
        -Only need entry point to be public, private is default
        -Incorrect while loop
        -Can work with ints etc where this is more clear, e.g. int x = 1, int o = 2, int empty = 0
